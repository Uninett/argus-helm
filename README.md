# Argus Helm chart

This is a [Helm](https://helm.sh/) chart repository hosting a Helm chart for deploying [Argus](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus).

Once you have helm set up, add the repo locally by using the following command:

```
helm repo add argus https://uninett.github.io/argus-helm/
```

`helm search repo argus` will show the helm charts in this repository, which should only be one chart for deploying Argus.
